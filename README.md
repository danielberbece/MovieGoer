The bot starts by opening a Google Chrome window and going to "https://cinemacity.ro". From then, it fetches data about all available movies and compiles them into a table. The user then chooses a movie (by typing its name into a dialog, or parts of it), location and the hour of the movie depending on availability.

The bot then proceeds to select the movie and book an available cozy seat for the user.
